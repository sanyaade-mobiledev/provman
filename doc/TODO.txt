* Binary plugins

  Replace hardcoded plugins with executables.  Doing so would mean that we have
  no license conflict issues for the plugins and it should increase security
  as each binary plugin can be given the rights it needs, and only the rights it
  needs, to perform its various tasks.

EDS Plugin:

* Make sure internal cache is synchronised with evolution. We could do this by
  deleting the internal cache at the end of each session as the oFono plugin
  does.  We could also listen for notifications to changes in email accounts
  during a session.

SyncE Plugin:

* Add RemoteDeviceId parameter

* Make sure internal cache is synchronised with evolution. We could do this by
  deleting the internal cache at the end of each session as the oFono plugin
  does.  We could also listen for notifications to changes in syncronisation
  accounts during a session.

oFono Plugin

* Check the use of cancellable in the oFono plugin.

  Do we really need to destroy the cancellable object and create a new one
  each time we invoke an asynchronous command.

* Listen to notifications and update internal data model.  This is only
  necessary during a session as the oFono plugin now deletes the cache
  at the end of each session.

* The oFono plugin caches all MMS accounts during a session even though only
  one account is ever used.  This cache is not currently used. However, it could
  be used to update the settings cache during a session.  Currently, if you
  delete an MMS account during a session, and then perform a GetAll during the
  same session the oFono plugin will report that no MMS account is provisioned,
  which will not be correct if multiple MMS accounts are provisioned in the
  system. If you end the current session and start a new session, MMS settings
  will be made available once more.  This is a little inconsistent and we could
  fix this by copying the cached mms account into main settings cache.  There
  are some implications of doing this.  If we simply copy the mms backup cache
  into the settings cache, no mms context will be deleted when the session ends.
  Instead the settings from the backup cache will be duplicated in the initial
  mms context.

MeeGo Login Plugin

* Needs to be written.
