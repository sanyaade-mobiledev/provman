* Meta data
 
  Need to allow meta data to be associated with settings.  Needed for OMA DM
  and OMA CP.

* Lazy invocation of sync_in

  Investigate whether it would be possible to use lazy evaluations for plugins,
  i.e., do not call sync in, until a client actually reads or modifies settings
  maintained by the plugin.  This will be advantageous when we have many plugins
  and the client only wishes to modify settings owned by a small number of these
  plugins.

* Binary plugins

  Replace hardcoded plugins with executables.  Doing so would mean that we have
  no license conflict issues for the plugins and it should increase security
  as each binary plugin can be given the rights it needs, and only the rights it
  needs, to perform its various tasks.

EDS Plugin:

* Listen to notifications and update internal data model

SyncE Plugin:

* Add RemoteDeviceId parameter

* Listen to notifications and update internal data model

oFono Plugin

* Check the use of cancellable in the oFono plugin.

  Do we really need to destroy the cancellable object and create a new one
  each time we invoke an asynchronous command.

* Listen to notifications and update internal data model

MeeGo Login Plugin

* Needs to be written.
